	Since the first photo was captured in the early 1820s, people have realized the importance<br> of them. We are fascinated with creating memories<br>. We want to freeze special moments to be able to<br> transport ourselves back in time to that exact moment<br>

As a fine art photographer,<br> I specialize in creating a story that tells the love between people<br> in a tangible way â€“ full of life and beauty<br>. I chose to create this art by using film photography, which gives me the ability to create a timeless look that is refined and elegant. This allows for my clients to be able to enjoy their photos for many decades to come.
